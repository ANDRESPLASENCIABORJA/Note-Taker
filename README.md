# Note-Taker

## Description

My motivation to build this project was to practice express routing by building an application that takes notes from the user input, store them on a json file and then returns them to the user, so the user can see them.

The reason to build this project was again to improve my routing skills by connectiong the front and the backend of a full stack web application.

The main lesson of this project was how to achieve the note saving on the json file.
